[PySniffer](https://github.com/SinaraPimenta/PySniffer) is a tool to analyze Open-Source Python projects hosted on GitHub, looking for the modules used (from the Standard Library as well as from external libraries), in order to generate statistics about the usage of Python modules. 

This repository hosts the PySniffer Web Application, which is a platform for displaying the collected results and making the tool available. 

The project was made for the Undergraduate Thesis on Computer Engineering of Instituto Nacional de Telecomunicações (INATEL).

 ### 🎯 Application purpose
The objective is to offer a platform to more easily access the results collected by PySniffer and display this collected data in a more user-friendly way, making it easier to understand the information and what is possible to obtain through the use of the developed tool.

### 💻 Functionalities

- Allows the download of the PySniffer;
- Displays the list of modules found by the tool;
- Allows you to search in the list and filter the result by module origin;
- Allows you to download the list of modules in CSV format;
- Displays results collected with PySniffer through graphs.
